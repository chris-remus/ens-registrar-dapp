This ENS Registrar DApp is temporarily deactivated. It was deactivated on [DATE] and will be restored at a later date. The team building ENS decided its resources are best spent right now on developing core registrar functionality.

Many third party integrations have emerged since the ENS launch. The following is a list of sites you can use to register ENS names in the meantime.

We suggest you take a look at them. Then choose the one youâ€™re most comfortable with and use it to register your selected ENS name(s).

This list is provided as a convenience. The ENS team does not endorse one site over another. Inclusion on the site does not constitute endorsement, either.

The best place to connect with the ENS team is [the official ENS Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/ethereum/go-ethereum/name-registry). The ENS team and community would be happy to answer any questions you have there.
